        <p>Heyyyyy, can you believe it’s going to be our <strong>3rd Valentine’s together</strong> 💖✨? I know it feels unreal, but we did it 🤍. I love you so much, my dear 💞.</p>

        <p>These years while we were away, you never even once failed to cheer up my day 🌷. You’re truly the best partner I could ever ask for 💗✨.</p>

        <p>I am so lucky to have a girlfriend like you who can be my best friend, my partner, and my world at the same time 🌍💘. I am so proud of how far we came together 🌸.</p>

        <p>Just three years ago, we barely knew each other, but look at us now ✨💞. We survived one year of long distance 🤍. I know it’s hard and scary, but I promise to never let go of your hand 🤝💖.</p>

        <p>I haven’t let go since November 17, 2023 💗.</p>

        <p>Put some faith in us, amor 🤍✨. We’ll get through this together — hand in hand and with love 💕💫.</p>

        <p class="signature">I love you 💖<br>Yours truly,<br><strong>Ameer</strong> 💗✨</p>
